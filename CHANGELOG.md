# Changelog

## [3.0.0] - 2023-10-23

### Added

- `dtype` configuration variable in `Config` to set precision of calculations.
- `Kerr` gate calculation in `PureFockSimulator` performance improved.
- Gradient calculation in `TensorflowPureFockSimulator` got improved.
- A method called `PureFockState.mean_position` which calculates the average position
  in a specified mode.
- `normalize` configuration variable in `Config` to enable/disable normalization of
  states `PureFockSimulator` and `FockSimulator`.

### Changed

- `Displacement` parametrization is simplified.
- The autoscaling of single mode gates got deleted.

### Fixed

- Vacuum state typing issue fixed in `PureFockSimulator`.
- Calculation error during gradient calculation.


## [2.2.0] - 2023-03-07

### Changed

- Several major performance improvements got implemented in
  `TensorflowPureFockSimulator`.

### Fixed

- `quantum-blackbird` version got bumped for `numpy` compatibility.
- `Kerr` gate was applied with a wrong equation, it got corrected.
- Typing error was fixed when applying `Interferometer` in
  `TensorflowPureFockSimulator`.


## [2.1.0] - 2023-02-08

### Added

- Performance increase for the `PureFockSimulator` and `TensorflowPureFockSimulator`.

### Fixed

- `GaussianState.fidelity` gave incorrect results for multiple modes and it
  needed to be corrected.
- During Williamson decomposition, sometimes `scipy.linalg.sqrtm` returned with
  complex matrices instead of real ones which caused problems so it is manually
  casted to real.
- In `TensorflowPureFockSimulator`, the gradient of the displacement gate
  matrix was not applied properly to the upstream gradient, a conjugation is
  added.
- Using `TensorflowPureFockSimulator`, the input of the `Interferometer` gate
  was not converted to a `tensorflow.Tensor` automatically, which has been
  included.


## [2.0.0] - 2022-10-30

### Added

- A simulator class called `TensorflowPureFockSimulator`, which uses Tensorflow
  and is able to calculate gradients.

### Changed

-  By enabling Tensorflow support, we dropped support for customizing the
   permanent, hafnian and loop hafnian calculations through `Config`.


## [1.0.1] - 2022-09-05

### Fixed

- `SamplingSimulator` along with `Loss` using uniform transmissivity
  (transmittance) parameters and `ParticleNumberMeasurement` produced only-zero
  samples instead of the expected samples.


## [1.0.0] - 2022-04-26

### Added

- Support for `Attenuator` in `FockSimulator` and `PureFockSimulator`.
- `LossyInterferometer` channel for `SamplingSimulator`.
- Possibility to provide the `hafnian` as a function in `piquasso.Config`.

### Changed

- The occupation number order has been changed from lexicographic to
  anti-lexicographic.
- The `piquasso.api.errors` module got renamed to `piquasso.api.exceptions`.
- The `Sampling` measurement class has been unified with
  `ParticleNumberMeasurement`.

### Fixed

- `Kerr` gate calculations were incorrect for multiple modes in `FockSimulator`
  and `PureFockSimulator`.
- Calculations that were incorrect for multiple modes using `FockSimulator`
  along with `Squeezing`, `Displacement` or `CubicPhase`.
- Symmetric tensorpower ordering in Fock-backend simulations.
- Handling 0 matrix elements at Clements decomposition.
