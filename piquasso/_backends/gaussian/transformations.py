    Basis changing with the basis change operator

    .. math::

        T_{ij} = \delta_{j, 2i-1} + \delta_{j + 2d, 2i}

    Intuitively, it changes the basis as

    .. math::

        T Y = T (x_1, \dots, x_d, p_1, \dots, p_d)^T
            = (x_1, p_1, \dots, x_d, p_d)^T,

    which is very helpful in :mod:`piquasso._backends.gaussian.state`.

    Args:
        d (int): The number of modes.

    Returns:
        numpy.ndarray: The basis changing matrix.
