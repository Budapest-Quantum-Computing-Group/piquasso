        Assuming that a graph's adjacency matrix is embedded into the circuit, the
        samples from particle number measurement naturally favor dense subgraphs. The
        samples could be converted to subgraph modes using this method.

        The resulting subgraph node indices correspond to the indices in the adjacency
        matrix.

        Only meaningful for discrete samples generated by
        :class:`ParticleNumberMeasurement`.
