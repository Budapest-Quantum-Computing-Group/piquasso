    """
    The implementation of qumodes, which is used to track on which qumodes are
    the operators placed in the circuit.

    Example usage::

        import numpy as np
        import piquasso as pq

        with pq.Program() as program:
            pq.Q(0, 1) | pq.Squeezing(r=0.5)

        simulator = pq.GaussianSimulator(d=5)
        result = simulator.execute(program)

    In the above example, the :class:`~piquasso.instructions.gates.Squeezing` gate
    is applied to modes `0, 1`.

    Note, that it is not necessarily required to specify any modes, if the context
    permits, e.g. when registering states.

    One could use the `all` keyword to indicate that the registered
    :class:`~piquasso.api.instruction.Instruction` mashould be applied to all modes,
    i.e.::

        with pq.Program() as program:
            pq.Q(0, 1) | pq.Squeezing(r=0.5)

            pq.Q(all) | pq.ParticleNumberMeasurement()

    or alternatively no parameters, i.e.::

        with pq.Program() as program:
            pq.Q(0, 1) | pq.Squeezing(r=0.5)

            pq.Q() | pq.ParticleNumberMeasurement()
