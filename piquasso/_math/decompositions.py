    Decomposes a positive definite matrix with Williamson decomposition, i.e. a
    positive definite :math:`M` is decomposed to

    .. math::

        M = S D S^T,

    where :math:`S \in \operatorname{Sp}(\mathbb{R}, 2d)` is a real symplectic matrix,
    and :math:`D` is a diagonal matrix containing positive values in the diagonal.

    The algorithm works as follows: without loss of generality, one can write the
    symplectic matrix in the form of

    .. math::

        S = M^{1 / 2} K D^{- 1 / 2}

    with :math:`K \in O(2d)`, since then

    .. math::

        M = S D S^T

    by construction. Now we need to find such :math:`K` that the value of :math:`S` is
    symplectic.

    .. math::

        S^T \Omega S = \Omega
            \rightleftarrow
            M^{- 1 / 2} J M^{- 1 / 2} = K D^{- 1 / 2} J D^{- 1 / 2} K^T,

    where

    .. math::

        D^{- 1 / 2} J D^{- 1 / 2}
            =
            \begin{bmatrix}
                0            & \hat{D}^{-1} \\
                \hat{D}^{-1} & 0            \\
            \end{bmatrix}

    is an antisymmetric matrix. We also know that :math:`M^{- 1 / 2} J M^{- 1 / 2}` is
    also antisymmetric. We just need to deduce the orthogonal transformation :math:`K`
    to acquire the symplectic matrix :math:`S`.

    We can use a (real) Schur decomposition to block-diagonalize
    :math:`M^{- 1 / 2} J M^{- 1 / 2}`. Note, that we also rotate the block to have the
    positive values in the above the diagonal to acquire real-valued symplectic matrices
    in the Williamson decomposition. Finally, we can acquire
    :math:`D^{- 1 / 2} J D^{- 1 / 2}` with a simple basis change.
