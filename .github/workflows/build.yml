        # NOTE: Although all wheels can be built, they are not tested currently.
        # However, a comment is left for someone in the future trying to solve this.
        #
        # Problem:
        # Scipy is distributed as sdist sometimes, because it is not built for every
        # architecture cibuildwheel is able to run tests on. The wheel would contain
        # every library, but an sdist needs to be built on the machine, and it
        # requires openblas for building:
        # https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-1.7.1/reference/building/windows.html#installing-openblas
        # However, yum openblas library is sometimes not registered in pkgconfig on
        # install.
        # Therefore, we would need to create an `openblas.pc` file manually, see
        # https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/16308#issuecomment-1339714289
        # But then, there are architectures where openblas is not even distributed.
        # This makes installing scipy for testing a nontrivial task.
        #
        # Undeterred, one could just skip testing these cases. But it would require us
        # going through all the architectures and determine which is easy to test.
        # Since the build identifiers are only parsed with `fnmatch`
        # (see: https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/options/#build-skip),
        # it is also tricky to enable testing only on certain architectures.
        #
        # To make it simple, we build every wheel and skip the tests altogether, and
        # pray that it works. If the wheel does not work, we instruct the user to try
        # installing it from sdist.
